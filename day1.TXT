1.Find the time complexity for the following code snippet: 
a = 1;
b = 1; 
while(b <= n) { 
	a = a + 1;
	b = b + a; 
	cout<<"Hi"; }
Answer: for the following snippet the complexcity is big oh(n).

2. Find the time complexity for the following code snippet: 
for(i = n; i >= 1; i = i/3) 
	cout<<"Hi";
Answer: for the following snippet the complexcity is tetha(log n base3).
